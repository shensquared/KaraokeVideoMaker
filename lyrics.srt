00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,250
Welcome to 6.390!

1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,160
Jump into the learning where the algorithms groove.

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,899
Supervised, unsupervised, 

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
let's find our rhythm and move!

4
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's dive into the data. Find the stories we can tell. 

4
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:24,320
With six three-nine-oh knowledge.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:39,920
We're under a machine learning spell. Linear, non-linear, we will dance through every way.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,700
Gradient descent is our partner, taking us to sway. From theory to the practice.

6
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,240
We'll navigate the scene. In the land of algorithms.

7
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,420
We'll build our dream machine. Oh, welcome to 6390.

8
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,130
where the excitement flows, With every model built, we're ready to break those codes.

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,570
Reinforcement learning is calling. Let's get up on our feet.

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,260
With funky neural networks, we can't be beat.

11
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,040
