1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,100
Jump into the learning where the algorithms groove.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,899
Supervised, unsupervised, 

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,320
let's find our rhythm and move!

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,320
Oh let's dive into the data, find the stories we can tell. 

5
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,320
With six three-nine-oh knowledge.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:34,920
We're under machine learning's spell. 

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,920
Linear, and non-linear, we will dance through every way.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,700
Gradient descent is our partner, taking us to sway. 

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,700
From theory to the practice,

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,240
We'll navigate the scene. 

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,420
In the land of algorithms, we'll build our dream machine~

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,130
Oh, welcome to 6.390, where the excitement flows!

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,130
With every model built, we're ready to break those codes!

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,570
Reinforcement learning is calling, let's get up on our feet.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:20,260
With funky neural networks, we can't be beat!

16
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,040
